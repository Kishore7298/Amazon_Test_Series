## Find nth element of spiral matrix

Given a matrix with n rows and m columns. Your task is to find the kth element which is obtained while traversing the matrix spirally. You need to complete the method findK which takes four arguments the first argument is the matrix A and the next two arguments will be n and m denoting the size of the matrix A and then the forth argument is an integer k denoting the kth element. The function will return the kth element obtained while traversing the matrix spirally.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
n = 3, m = 3, k = 4
A[][] = [[1 2 3],
         [4 5 6],
         [7 8 9]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The matrix above will look
like
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
and the 4th element in spiral fashion
will be 6.
```

#### Your Task:

You only need to implement the given function `findK()`. Do not read input, instead use the arguments given in the function. Return the K'th element obtained by traversing matrix spirally.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N*M)`
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N*M)`

```
Constraints:
1<=n,m<=20
1<=k<=n*m
```

```c++
/*You are required to complete this method*/
int findK(int A[MAX][MAX], int n, int m, int k)
{
    int top = 0, bottom = n-1, left = 0, right = m-1;
    int count = 0;
    while(top <= bottom && left <= right) {
        for(int i=left; i<= right; i++) {
            count++;
            if(count == k)
                return A[top][i];
        }
        top++;
        for(int i=top; i<=bottom; i++) {
            count++;
            if(count == k)
                return A[i][right];
        }
        right--;
        if(top <= bottom) {
            for(int i=right; i>=left; i--) {
                count++;
                if(count == k)
                    return A[bottom][i];
            }
            bottom--;
        }
        if(left <= right) {
            for(int i=bottom; i>=top; i--) {
                count++;
                if(count == k) {
                    return A[i][left];
                }
            }
            left++;
        }
    }
}
```

```
Efficient Approach: While traversing the array in spiral order, a loop is used to traverse the sides. So if it can be found out that the kth element is in the given side then the kth element can be found out in constant time. This can be done recursively as well as iteratively.


Algorithm :
Traverse the matrix in form of spiral or cycles.
So a cycle can be divided into 4 parts, so if the cycle is of size m X n.
Element is in first row, i.e k <= m
Element is in last column, i.e k <= (m+n-1)
Element is in last row, i.e. k <= (m+n-1+m-1)
Element is in first column, i.e k <= (m+n-1+m-1+n-2)
If any of the above conditions meet then the kth element can be found is constant time.
Else remove the cycle from the array and recursively call the function.
```

```c++
// C++ program for Kth element in spiral
// form of matrix
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define MAX 100
using namespace std;

/* function for Kth element */
int findK(int A[MAX][MAX], int n, int m, int k) {
    if (n < 1 || m < 1)
        return -1;

    /*....If element is in outermost ring ....*/
    /* Element is in first row */
    if (k <= m)
        return A[0][k - 1];

    /* Element is in last column */
    if (k <= (m + n - 1))
        return A[(k - m)][m - 1];

    /* Element is in last row */
    if (k <= (m + n - 1 + m - 1))
        return A[n - 1][m - 1 - (k - (m + n - 1))];

    /* Element is in first column */
    if (k <= (m + n - 1 + m - 1 + n - 2))
        return A[n - 1 - (k - (m + n - 1 + m - 1))][0];

    /*....If element is NOT in outermost ring ....*/
    /* Recursion for sub-matrix. &A[1][1] is
    address to next inside sub matrix.*/
    return findK((int(*)[MAX])(&(A[1][1])), n - 2, m - 2, k - (2 * n + 2 * m - 4));
}

/* Driver code */
int main()
{
    int a[MAX][MAX] = { { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 },
                        { 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 },
                        { 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 } };
    int k = 17;
    cout << findK(a, 3, 6, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
