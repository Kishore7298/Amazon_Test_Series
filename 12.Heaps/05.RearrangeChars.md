## Rearrange characters

Given a string S with repeated characters (only lowercase). The task is to rearrange characters in a string such that no two adjacent characters are same.

Note : It may be assumed that the string has only lowercase English alphabets.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
    S = geeksforgeeks
Output: 1
Explanation: All the repeated characters
of the given string can be rearranged so
that no adjacent characters in the
string is equal.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
    S = bbbabaaacd
Output: 1
Explanation: Repeated characters in the
string cannot be rearranged such that
there should not be any adjacent repeated
character.
```

#### Your Task:

You are required to complete the method `rearrangeString()` which takes 1 argument and returns the string without any same adjacent character.

Expected Time Complexity : `O(nlogn)`  
Expected Auxilliary Space : `O(n)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= length of string <= 10^4
```

```c++
/*
    Put highest frequency character first (a greedy approach). Use Binary Max Heap and
    put all characters and ordered by their frequencies (highest frequency character at root).
    one by one take highest frequency character from the heap and add it to result.
    Once added, decrease frequency of the character and temporarily move this character
    out of Max Heap so that it is not picked next time.
*/

string rearrangeString(string str){
	unordered_map<char, int> mp;
	for(int i=0; i<str.length(); i++) {
	    mp[str[i]] ++;
	}
	priority_queue<pair<int, char>> pq;
	for(auto itr: mp)
	    pq.push({itr.second, itr.first});

	 string res = "";
	 res += pq.top().second;
	 pair<int, char> pending = pq.top();
	 pq.pop();
	 pending.first -= 1;

	 while(pq.empty() == false) {
	     auto first = pq.top();
	     pq.pop();
	     res += first.second;
	     if(pending.first > 0)
	        pq.push(pending);
	     if(first.first > 0)
	        pending = { first.first-1, first.second };
	 }

	 while(pending.first > 0) {
	     res += pending.second;
	     pending.first -= 1;
	 }
	 return res;
}
```
