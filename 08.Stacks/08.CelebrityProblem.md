## The Celebrity Problem

A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. If you go to a party of N people, find if there is a celebrity in the party or not.
A square NxN matrix `M[][]` is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. Here `M[i][i]` will always be 0.  
Note: Follow 0 based indexing.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 3
M[][] = {{0 1 0},
         {0 0 0},
         {0 1 0}}
Output: 1
Explanation: 0th and 2nd person both
know 1. Therefore, 1 is the celebrity.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 2
M[][] = {{0 1},
         {1 0}}
Output: -1
Explanation: The two people at the party both
know each other. None of them is a celebrity.
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function `celebrity()` which takes the matrix M and its size N as input parameters and returns the index of the celebrity. If no such celebrity is present, return -1.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`

```
Constraints:
2 <= N <= 3000
0 <= M[][] <= 1
```

#### My approach:

```
Use stack to verity celebrity.

1. Push all the celebrities into a stack.
2. Pop off top two persons from the stack, discard one person based on return status of Mat(A, B).
3. Push the remained person onto stack.
4. Repeat step 2 and 3 until only one person remains in the stack.

Check the remained person in stack doesnâ€™t have acquaintance with anyone else or not.
```

```c++
int celebrity(vector<vector<int> >& M, int n) {
       stack<int> st;
       for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
            st.push(i);
        while(st.empty() != true && st.size() > 1) {
            int first = st.top();
            st.pop();
            int second = st.top();
            st.pop();
            if(M[first][second] == 1 && M[second][first] == 1)// If they both know each other, neither can be celebrity
                continue;
            if(M[first][second] == 1) {// first knows second, second can be celebrity
                st.push(second);
            } else if(M[second][first] == 1) {  // second knows first, first can be celebrity
                st.push(first);
            }
            // other case is: Both of them don't know each other
        }
        if(st.empty())
            return -1;

        int elem = st.top();
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if(i != elem && M[i][elem] == 0)
                return -1;
        }
        return elem;
    }
```

#### Efficient Approach:

```c++
int celebrity(vector<vector<int> >& M, int n) {
    // Initialize two pointers  as two corners
    int a = 0;
    int b = n - 1;

    // Keep moving till the two pointers
    // don't become same.
    while (a < b) {
        if (M[a][b])
            a++;
        else
            b--;
    }

    // Check if a is actually
    // a celebrity or not
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        // If any person doesn't
        // know 'a' or 'a' doesn't
        // know any person, return -1
        if ( (i != a) && (M[a][i] || !M[i][a]) )
            return -1;
    }
    return a;
}
```
