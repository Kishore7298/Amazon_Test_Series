## Peak element

Given an array A of N integers. The task is to find a peak element in A in O( log N ) .
An array element is peak if it is not smaller than its neighbours. For corner elements, consider only one neighbour.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 3
A[] = {1,2,3}
Output: 2
Explanation: In the given array,
3 is the peak element as it is
greater than its neighbour.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 2
A[] = {3,4}
Output: 1
Explanation: 4 is the peak element
as it is greater than its neighbour
elements.
```

#### Your Task:

You don't have to read input or print anything. Just complete the provided function peakElement() and return a valid index with respect to 0 based indexing.  
Note 1: Multiple peak element may be possible, in that case return any of the valid index .  
Note 2: If you click on Compile and Test the output will be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(log N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= A[] <= 10^6
```

```c++
/* The function should return the index of any
   peak element present in the array */

// arr: input array
// n: size of array
/* The function should return the index of any
   peak element present in the array */
// function to find the peak element

int peakElement(int arr[], int n)
{
    int low = 0, high = n-1;
    while(low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low)/2;
        if((mid == 0 || arr[mid-1] <= arr[mid]) && (mid == n-1 || arr[mid+1] <= arr[mid])) {
            return mid;
        } else if (mid != 0 && arr[mid-1] > arr[mid]) {
            high = mid-1;
        } else {
            low = mid+1;
        }
    }
}
```
