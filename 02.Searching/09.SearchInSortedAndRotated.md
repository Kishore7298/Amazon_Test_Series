## Search in a Sorted and Rotated Array

Given a sorted and rotated array A of N distinct elements which is rotated at some point, and given an element K. The task is to find the index of the given element K in the array A.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 9
A[] = {5 6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3}
K = 10
Output: 5
Explanation: 10 is found at index 5.
```

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 3
A[] = {3,1,2}
K = 1
Output: 1
```

#### User Task:

Complete `Search()` function and return the index of the element K if found in the array. If the element is not present, then return `-1`.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(log N)`.
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`.

```
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^7
0 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^8
1 ≤ K ≤ 10^8
```

```c++
// vec : given vector of elements
// K : given value whose index we need to find
int Search(vector<int> a, int K) {
    int low = 0, high = a.size()-1;

    while(low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high-low)/2;
        if(a[mid] == K) {
            return mid;
        } else {
            if(a[mid] >= a[low]) {
                //left side is sorted
                if(K >= a[low] && K <= a[mid-1]) {
                    high = mid-1;
                } else {
                    low = mid+1;
                }
            } else {
                // Right side is sorted
                if(K >= a[mid+1] && K <= a[high])
                    low = mid+1;
                else
                    high = mid-1;
            }
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```
