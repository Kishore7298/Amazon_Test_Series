## Square root

Given an integer x. The task is to find the square root of x. If x is not a perfect square, then return `floor(√x)`.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 5 is not perfect
square, so floor of square_root of
5 is 2.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect
square, so its square root is 2.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `floorSqrt()` which should return the square root of given number x.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(log N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`.

```
Constraints:
1 ≤ x ≤ 10^7
```

```c++
// Function to find square root
// x: element to find square root
long long int floorSqrt(long long int x)
{
    long long res;
    if(x == 1 || x == 0)
        return x;

    long long l = 1, h = x;
    while(l <= h) {
        long long mid = l + (h-l)/2;
        if(mid*mid == x)
            return mid;
        else if (mid * mid < x) {
            res = mid;
            l = mid+1;
        } else {
            h = mid-1;
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```
