## K closest point to origin

Given a list of points on the 2-D plane and an integer K. The task is to find K closest points to the origin and print them.

Note: The distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.You are require to prints the points in increasing order of their distance from the origin. If two points are at same distance from origin then print points in sorted order.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 3, K = 2
Points[] = {(3,3),(5,-1),(-2,4)}
Output: 3 3 -2 4
Explanation: Distance between (-2, 4) and
origin is sqrt(20).
Distance between (3, 3) and origin is
sqrt(18).
Distance between (5, -1) and origin is
sqrt(26).
Since two(K) shortest distance from origin
are from points (-2, 4) and (3, 3).
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 3, K = 2
Points[] = {(1,3),(-1,3),(5,8)}
Output: -1 3 1 3
Explanation: Distance between (-1, 3) and
origin is sqrt(10).
Distance between (1, 3) and origin is
sqrt(10).
Distance between (5, 8) and origin is
sqrt(89).
Since two(K) shortest distance from origin
are from points (-1, 3) and (1, 3)
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete `kClosest()` function and return the 2D array `points[][]` of size N x 2 denoting the (X,Y) cooridinates of each point and an integer K. Your task is to return a 2D array(vector/arraylist depending upon the language you choose) of size K x 2 denoting the (X,Y) coordinates of the K-closest points to the origin.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(nLogn)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(n)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= K <= N
-1000 <= (X,Y) <= 1000
```

```c++
double distance(int x,int y) {
    return sqrt(pow(x,2)+pow(y,2));
}
bool comp(vector<int>& v1,vector<int>&v2) {
    if(distance(v1[0],v1[1])!=distance(v2[0],v2[1]))
        return distance(v1[0],v1[1])<distance(v2[0],v2[1]);

    if(v1[0]!=v2[0])
        return v1[0]<v2[0];

    return v1[1]<v2[1];
}
vector<vector<int>> kClosest(vector<vector<int>>& p, int K) {
    int n=p.size();
    sort(p.begin(), p.end(), comp);
    p.resize(K);
    return p;
}
```
