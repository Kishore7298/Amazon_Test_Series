## Count possible triangles

Given an unsorted array arr[] of positive integers. Find the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array elements as lengths of three sides of triangles.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
3
3 5 4

Output:
1

Explanation:
A triangle is possible
with all the elements 5, 3 and 4.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
5
6 4 9 7 8

Output:
10

Explanation:
There are 10 triangles
possible  with the given elements like
(6,4,9), (6,7,8),...
```

#### Your Task:

This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function `findNumberOfTriangles()` that takes `arr[]` and N as input parameters and returns the count of total possible triangles.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N^2)`.
Expected Space Complexity: `O(1)`.

```
Constraints:
3 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^3
```

```c++
int findNumberOfTriangles(int arr[], int n) {
    int count = 0;
    sort(arr, arr+n);
    for(int i = n-1; i>=0; i--) {
        int low = 0, high = i-1;
        while(low < high) {
            if(arr[low] + arr[high] > arr[i]) {
                count += high - low;
                high--;
            } else {
                low++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```
