## Minimize the heights

Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K, modify the heights of each tower either by increasing or decreasing them by K only once. Find out the minimum difference of the heights of shortest and longest modified towers.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
K = 2, N = 4
Arr[] = {1, 5, 8, 10}
Output: 5
Explanation: The array can be modified as
{3, 3, 6, 8}. The difference between
the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
K = 3, N = 5
Arr[] = {3, 9, 12, 16, 20}
Output: 11
Explanation: The array can be modified as
{6 12 9 13 17}. The difference between
the largest and the smallest is 17-6 = 11.
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `getMinDiff()` which takes the `arr[]`, n and k as input parameters and returns an integer denoting the minimum difference.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N*logN)`
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`

```
Constraints
1 <= K <= 10^4
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= Arr[i] <= 10^5
```

```c++
int getMinDiff(int arr[], int n, int k) {
        if(n == 1)
            return 0;
        sort(arr, arr+n);

        // The option is to minimize the heights by either choosing or not choosing the k
        // If we don't choose to use k then arr[n-1] and arr[0] are the max and min height.
        // So minimum of these two are taken later.
        int ans = arr[n-1] - arr[0];

        int big = arr[n-1] - k; // Possible big
        int small = arr[0] +k;  //possible min

        if(small > big)
            swap(big, small);

        for(int i=1; i<n-1; i++) {  // For all the elements
            int add = arr[i] + k;
            int substract = arr[i] - k;

            // As we are trying to minimize the height, we don't have to choose the minimum or maximum height
            // out of the options, if the add is smaller than big, then we choose this or if it is greater
            // so we ignore for the following case
            if(add <= big || substract >= small)
                continue;

            // If it fails to go to the above case, then we can't ignore the element
            // We try to minimize the height by picking add or substract, which gives the minimum height.
            if(big - substract <= add - small)
                small = substract;
            else
                big = add;
        }
        return min(ans, big-small);
    }
```
