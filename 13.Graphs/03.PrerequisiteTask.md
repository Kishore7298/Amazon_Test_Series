## Prerequisite Tasks

There are a total of N tasks, labeled from 0 to N-1. Some tasks may have prerequisites, for example to do task 0 you have to first complete task 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0, 1]

Given the total number of tasks and a list of prerequisite pairs, find if it is possible to finish all tasks.

#### Input:

First line of input contains number of test cases T. Then T test cases will follow. The first line of each test case contains N denoting the total number of tasks. This is followed by P denoting the total number of prerequisite pairs. This is followed by P lines each containing a dependency pair.

#### Output:

Print Yes if it is possible to finish all tasks otherwise print No.

#### User Task:

The task is to complete the function canFinish that takes the total number of tasks and prerequisite pairs as input and returns the desired boolean value.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N + P)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N + P)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10^5
1 <= N <= 100
```

#### Example:

```
Input:
2
4
3
1 0
2 1
3 2
2
2
1 0
0 1
Output:
Yes
No

Explanation:
Testcase 2: To do task 1 you should have completed task 0, and to do task 0 you should have finished task 1. So it is impossible
```

#### My approach

```c++
// given total number of tasks and prerequisite pairs as input
bool canFinish(int numTasks, vector<pair<int, int> >& prerequisites) {
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> mp;
    unordered_map<int, int> dep;

    for(pair<int, int> itr: prerequisites) {
        if(dep.find(itr.second) == dep.end())
            dep[itr.second] = 0;
        dep[itr.first]++;
        mp[itr.second].push_back(itr.first);
    }

    queue<int> q;
    for(auto itr: dep) {
        if(itr.second == 0) {   // no dependency
            q.push(itr.first);
        }
    }

    while(q.empty() == false) {
        int elem = q.front();
        q.pop();

        for(int adj: mp[elem]) {
            dep[adj]--;
            if(dep[adj] == 0) {
                q.push(adj);
            }
        }
    }

    for(auto itr: dep) {
        if(itr.second > 0)
            return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```
