## Word Ladder

Given two distinct words start and target, and a set denoting a dictionary of unique words of equal lengths. Find the length of the shortest transformation sequence from start to target.
Keep the following conditions in mind:

1. A word can only consist of lowercase characters.
2. Only one letter can be changed in each transformation.
3. Each transformed word must exist in the dictionary.
4. The starting word may not exist in the dictionary.
5. Target will always be in the dictionary otherwise the path is not possible and you should return 0.

#### Input:

The first line of input contains the number of testcases T. For each testcase, the first line contains N which is the number of words in the dictionary. Then the next N lines will contain the words of the dictionary. Following this, the second last line contains the start word and the last line will contain the end word.

#### Output:

For every test case, print the length of the shortest transformation sequence from start to target.

#### Your Task:

You only need to implement the given function `WordLadderLength()` which takes start, end string and a dictionary of unique words of equal lengths as input parameters. Reading input is not required, instead use the arguments in the given function. Return the length of the shortest transformation sequence from start to target. Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N^2 * M)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Length of the words (M) <= 10
```

#### Example:

```
Input:
    1
    7
    poon
    plee
    same
    poie
    plea
    plie
    poin
    toon
    plea

Output:
    7

Explanation:
The length of the smallest transformation sequence from toon to plea is 7 i.e. toon -> poon -> poin -> poie -> plie -> plee -> plea
```

```c++
//User function Template for C++

// start is the begin word
// target is the end word
// D is a dictionary of unique words of equal length

int WordLadderLength(string start, string target, set<string>& wordList) {
    if(wordList.find(target) == wordList.end())
        return 0;

    int level = 0;
    queue<string> q;
    q.push(start);

    while(q.empty() == false) {
        int q_len = q.size();
        level++;

        for(int k = 0; k<q_len; k++) {
            string elem = q.front();
            q.pop();
            for(int i=0; i<elem.length(); i++) {
                char original = elem[i];
                for(char j = 'a'; j <= 'z'; j++) {  // This is constant operation (Only low case letters)
                    elem[i] = j;

                    if(elem  == target)
                        return level+1;

                    if(wordList.find(elem) != wordList.end()) {
                        wordList.erase(elem);
                        q.push(elem);
                    }
                }
                elem[i] = original;
            }
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
