## Print Common Nodes in two BSTs

Given two Binary Search Trees(without duplicates). Find need to print the common nodes in them. In other words, find intersection of two BSTs

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
BST1:
                  5
               /     \
             1        10
           /   \      /
          0     4    7
                      \
                       9
BST2:
                10
              /    \
             7     20
           /   \
          4     9
Output: 4 7 9 10
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
BST1:
     10
    /  \
   2   11
  /  \
 1   3
BST2:
       2
     /  \
    1    3
Output: 1 2 3
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `printCommon()` that takes roots of both the BSTs as input and returns an array containing the intersection of the 2 BSTs in a sorted order.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N1 + N2) where N1 and N2 are the sizes of the 2 BSTs`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(H1 + H2) where H1 and H2 are the Heights of the 2 BSTs.`

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^3
```

```c++
/*Node structure

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node *left;
    Node *right;

    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        left = right = NULL;
    }
};
*/

// return a vector containing the intersection of the two BSTs in a sorted order
vector<int> printCommon(Node *root1, Node *root2) {
    vector<int> res;
    if(root1 == NULL || root2 == NULL)
        return res;

    stack<Node*> s1, s2;
    Node *curr1 = root1, *curr2 = root2;

    while(1) {
        if(curr1 != NULL) {
            s1.push(curr1);
            curr1 = curr1->left;
        } else if (curr2 != NULL) {
            s2.push(curr2);
            curr2 = curr2->left;
        } else if (s1.empty() == false && s2.empty() == false ) {
            curr1 = s1.top();
            curr2 = s2.top();
            if(curr1->data == curr2->data) {
                res.push_back(curr1->data);
                curr1 = curr1->right;
                curr2 = curr2->right;
                s1.pop();
                s2.pop();
            } else if(curr1->data < curr2->data) {
                curr1 = curr1->right;
                s1.pop();
                curr2 = NULL;
            } else {
                curr2 = curr2->right;
                s2.pop();
                curr1 = NULL;
            }
        } else {
            // both curr1 & curr2 is NULL and also either of the stack is empty
            break;
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```
