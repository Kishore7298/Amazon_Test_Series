## Max sum path in two arrays

Given two sorted arrays A and B, such that the arrays may have some common elements. Find the sum of the maximum sum path to reach from the beginning of any array to end of any of the two arrays. We can switch from one array to another array only at the common elements.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
M = 5, N = 4
A[] = {2,3,7,10,12}
B[] = {1,5,7,8}
Output: 35
Explanation: The path will be 1+5+7+10+12
= 35.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
M = 3, N = 3
A[] = {1,2,4}
B[] = {1,2,7}
Output: 10
Explanation: The path will be 1+2+7=10.
```

#### Your Task:

Complete the function `max_path_sum()` that takes the two arrays A and B along with their sizes M and N as input parameters. It returns the sum of the maximum sum path.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(M + N)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= M,N <= 10^5
1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 10^6
```

```c++
int max_path_sum(int A[], int B[], int l1, int l2) {
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    int lSum = 0, rSum = 0, fSum = 0;
    // The approach is similar to merge sort, we move the pointer when the side element is less
    // The main strategy is to create partitions at every common element index, adding the one which is minimum
    while(i < l1 && j < l2) {
        if(A[i] > B[j])
            rSum += B[j++];

        else if (B[j] > A[i])
            lSum += A[i++];

        else if (A[i] == B[j]) {
            lSum += A[i++];
            rSum += B[j++];
            fSum += max(lSum, rSum);
            lSum = 0;
            rSum = 0;
        }

    }
    while(i < l1)
        lSum += A[i++];

    while(j < l2)
        rSum += B[j++];

    fSum += max(lSum, rSum);
    return fSum;
}
```
