## Overlapping Intervals

Given a collection of Intervals, the task is to merge all of the overlapping Intervals.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 4
Intervals = {(1,3),(2,4),(6,8),(9,10)}
Output: 1 4 6 8 9 10
Explanation: Given intervals: [1,3],[2,4]
[6,8],[9,10], we have only two overlapping
intervals here,[1,3] and [2,4]. Therefore
we will merge these two and return [1,4],
[6,8], [9,10].
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 4
Intervals = {(6,8),(1,9),(2,4),(4,7)}
Output: 1 9
```

#### Your Task:

Complete the function `overlappedInterval()` that takes the list of pairs and N as input parameters and returns sorted list of pairs of intervals after merging.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N*Log(N) )`.
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`.

```
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1000
```

```c++
vector<pair<int,int>> overlappedInterval(vector<pair<int,int>> vec, int n) {
    sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());   // Sorting based on the first index
    vector<pair<int, int>> result;
    pair<int, int> curr = vec[0];
    for(int i=1; i<n; i++) {
        if(curr.second >= vec[i].first) {
            curr.second = max(curr.second, vec[i].second);
        } else {
            result.push_back(curr);
            curr = vec[i];
        }
    }
    result.push_back(curr);
    return result;
}
```
