## Intersection of two arrays

Given two arrays A and B respectively of size N and M, the task is to print the count of elements in the intersection (or common elements) of the two arrays.

For this question, the intersection of two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct common elements between the two arrays.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
5 3
89 24 75 11 23
89 2 4

Output:
1

Explanation:
89 is the only element
in the intersection of two arrays.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
6 5
1 2 3 4 5 6
3 4 5 6 7

Output:
4

Explanation:
3 4 5 and 6 are the elements
in the intersection of two arrays.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `NumberofElementsInIntersection()` which takes 4 inputs ie- array a, array b, n which is the size of array a, m which is the size of array b. The function should return the count of the number of elements in the intersection.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N + M)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(min(N,M))`.

```
Constraints:
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ A[i], B[i] ≤ 10^5
```

```c++
// Given two arrays A and B and their sizes N and M respectively
int NumberofElementsInIntersection (int a[], int b[], int n, int m )
{
    int count = 0;
    sort(a, a+n);
    sort(b, b+m);
    int i=0, j=0;
    while(i<n && j<m) {
        if(a[i] != 0 && a[i] == a[i-1]) {
            i++;
            continue;
        }
        if(a[i] == b[j]) {
            count++;
            i++;
            j++;
        } else if(a[i] < b[j]) {
            i++;
        } else if(a[i] > b[j]) {
            j++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```
