## Max sum in the configuration

Given an array(0-based indexing), you have to find the max sum of i\*A[i] where A[i] is the element at index i in the array. The only operation allowed is to rotate(clock-wise or counter clock-wise) the array any number of times.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 4
A[] = {8,3,1,2}
Output: 29
Explanation: Above the configuration
possible by rotating elements are
3 1 2 8 here sum is 3*0+1*1+2*2+8*3 = 29
1 2 8 3 here sum is 1*0+2*1+8*2+3*3 = 27
2 8 3 1 here sum is 2*0+8*1+3*2+1*3 = 17
8 3 1 2 here sum is 8*0+3*1+1*2+2*3 = 11
Here the max sum is 29
```

#### Your Task:

Your task is to complete the function `max_sum` which takes two arguments which is the array `A [ ]` and its size and returns an integer value denoting the required max sum.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`.

```
Constraints:
1<=N<=10^4
1<=A[]<1000
```

```c++
int max_sum(int A[],int N) {
    int sum = 0;
    int currSum = 0;
    for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {
        // Finding the sum of all the elements and also pattern sum(i*a[i]) for original configuration
        sum += A[i];
        currSum += i*A[i];
    }
    int maxSum = currSum;   // Initializing the maxSum as the sum of the original configuration
    for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {    // Trying to compute the sum of rotation from sum of previous rotation
    /*
        Every time we rotate the array by 1, all the elements except the rotated element loses their
        values(sum) by multiples of 1. The element which gets rotated gets added at the bottom with n-1 * elem.
    */
        currSum = currSum -     // Previous sum
            (sum - A[i]) +      // substracting the lost values due to rotation
            (N-1)*A[i];         // Adding the last value by multiplying it with n-1
        maxSum = max(maxSum, currSum);  // Maximum out of all the possible configurations
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```
