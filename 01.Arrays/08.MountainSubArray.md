## Mountain Subarray Problem

We are given an array of integers and a range, we need to find whether the subarray which falls in this range has values in the form of a mountain or not. All values of the subarray are said to be in the form of a mountain if either all values are increasing or decreasing or first increasing and then decreasing. More formally a subarray [a1, a2, a3 … aN] is said to be in form of a mountain if there exists an integer K, `1 <= K <= N` such that,
`a1 <= a2 <= a3 .. <= aK >= a(K+1) >= a(K+2) …. >= aN`  
You have to process Q queries. In each query you are given two integer L and R, denoting starting and last index of the subarrays respectively.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 8
a[] = {2,3,2,4,4,6,3,2}
Q = 2
Queries = (0,2), (1,3)
Output:
Yes
No
Explanation: For L = 0 and R = 2, a0 = 2,
a1 = 3 and a2 = 2, since they are in the
valid order,answer is Yes.
For L = 1 and R = 3, a1 = 3, a2 = 2 and
a3 = 4, since a1 > a2 and a2 < a4 the
order isn't valid, hence the answer is
No.
```

#### Your Task:

Complete the function `processQueries()` which takes the array, size of array queries and number of queries as parameter. It should return a vector/ArrayList/array (depending upon language cpp/Java/Python) of boolean values, true if the subarray is in mountain form, false otherwise. The driver code will print "Yes" if the returned value is true, otherwise "No".

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N + Q)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N, Q <= 10^5
1 <= a[i] <= 10^6, for each valid i
0 <= L <= R <= N-1
```

Concept:- 1)We maintain two arrays left and right where left[i] stores the last index on the left side which is increasing i.e. greater than its previous element and
          right[i] will store the first index on the right side which is decreasing i.e. greater than its next element.
          2)Suppose range [l, r] is given then only if right[l] >= left[r]
          3)The reason we are doing it, we have to avoid the following pattern----  \         /   , rest 3 are allowed int the problem
                                                                                     \       /
                                                                                      \     /
                                                                                       \   /
                                                                                        \ /
          4)Since left subarray shows the pattern for some ith index:-     /     ie increasing
                                                                          /
                                                                         /
                                                                        /
          5)And right subarray shows the pattern for index i:-  \
                                                                 \
                                                                  \
                                                                   \
          6)by checking the the condition in point number 2,we try avoid the pattern that is not allowed(refer to point number 3 for pattern)

Time- O(n),Space - O(n)
```

```c++
vector<bool> processQueries(int a[], int n, vector<pair<int, int>> &queries,
                            int q) {
    vector<int> L(n), R(n);

    L[0] = 0;
    int l_ptr = 0;
    for(int i=1; i<n; i++) {
        if(a[i] > a[i-1])
            l_ptr = i;
        L[i] = l_ptr;
    }

    R[n-1] = n-1;
    int r_ptr = n-1;
    for(int i = n-2; i>=0; i--) {
        if(a[i] > a[i+1])
            r_ptr = i;
        R[i] = r_ptr;
    }

    vector<bool> res;
    for(int i=0; i<q; i++) {
        int left = queries[i].first;
        int right = queries[i].second;
        res.push_back(R[left] >= L[right]);
    }
    return res;
}
```
