Given an array A of N integers, find any 3 elements in it such that A[i] < A[j] < A[k] and i < j < k.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1,2,1,1,3}
Output: 1
Explanation: a sub-sequence 1 2 3 exist.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 3
A[] = {1,1,3}
Output: 0
Explanation: no such sub-sequence exist.
```

#### Your Task:

Your task is to complete the function find3Numbers which finds any 3 elements in it such that `A[i] < A[j] < A[k]` and `i < j < k`. You need to return them as a vector/ArrayList/array (depending on the language cpp/Java/Python), if no such element is present then return the empty vector of size 0.

Note: The output will be 1 if the sub-sequence returned by the function is present in array A else 0. If the sub-sequence returned by the function is not in the format as mentioned then the output will be -1.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, for each valid i
```

```c++
/*The function returns a vector containing the
increasing sub-sequence of length 3 if present
else returns an empty vector */
vector<int> find3Numbers(vector<int> arr, int N) {
    int L[N], R[N];
    L[0] = arr[0];
    for(int i=1; i<N; i++) {
        L[i] = min(arr[i], L[i-1]); // Finding the minimum from the left
    }
    R[N-1] = arr[N-1];
    for(int i = N-2; i>=0; i--) {
        R[i] = max(R[i+1], arr[i]); // Finding the maximum from the right
    }
    for(int i=1; i<N; i++) {
        if(L[i] < arr[i] && R[i] > arr[i]) {
            return { L[i], arr[i], R[i] };
        }
    }
    return {};
}
```
