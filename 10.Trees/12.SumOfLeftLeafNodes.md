## Sum of Left Leaf Nodes

Given a Binary Tree of size N. Find the sum of all the leaf nodes that are left child of their parent of the given binary tree.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
       1
     /   \
    2     3
Output: 2
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input :
         1
        /  \
       2    3
     /  \     \
    4    5     8
  /  \        /  \
 7    2      6    9
Output: 13
Explanation:
sum = 6 + 7 = 13
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `leftLeavesSum()` which takes the root node of the tree as input and returns the sum of all the left leaf nodes present in the given binary tree.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(Height of the Tree)`.

```
Constraints:
1<=Number of nodes<=10^5
```

```c++
/*Structure of the node of the binary tree is as
struct Node
{
    int data;
    struct Node* left;
    struct Node* right;
};
*/

void leftLeavesSumUtil(Node* root, int &sum) {
    if(root == NULL)
        return;

    if(root->left != NULL && root->left->left == NULL && root->left->right == NULL) {
        sum += root->left->data;
    }

    leftLeavesSumUtil(root->left, sum);
    leftLeavesSumUtil(root->right, sum);
}

// function should return the sum of all
// left leaf nodes
int leftLeavesSum(Node *root) {
    int sum = 0;
    leftLeavesSumUtil(root, sum);
    return sum;
}
```
