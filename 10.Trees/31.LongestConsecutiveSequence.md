## Longest consecutive sequence in Binary tree

Given a Binary Tree find the length of the longest path which comprises of nodes with consecutive values in increasing order.
Note:
Sequence of length 1 won't be considered.

#### Example 1:

```
Input :
           1
         /   \
        2     3

Output: 2

Explanation : Longest sequence is 1, 2.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input :
            10
         /     \
       20       30
      /  \      /
     40      60   90

Output :  -1

Explanation: For the above test case no
sequence is possible. So output is -1.
```

#### Your Task:

You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function `longestConsecutive()` which takes root node as input parameter and returns the length of the longest consecutive increasing sequence (of at least length 2) in the given Binary Tree. If such a sequence does not exist, it returns -1.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(Height of Tree)`

```
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3
```

```c++
/*
struct Node
{
	int data;
	Node *left, *right;
};
*/

void longestConsecutiveUtil(Node* root, int consec, int prevValue, int &maxConsec) {
    if(root == NULL)
        return;

    if(root->data == prevValue + 1)
        consec++;
    else
        consec = 1;
    maxConsec = max(maxConsec, consec);
    longestConsecutiveUtil(root->left, consec, root->data, maxConsec);
    longestConsecutiveUtil(root->right, consec, root->data, maxConsec);
}

// your task is tp complete this function
// function should return the length of the longestConsecutive
// sequence
int longestConsecutive(Node* root) {
    int maxConsec = INT_MIN;
    longestConsecutiveUtil(root, 1, INT_MIN, maxConsec);
    return maxConsec == 1 ? -1 : maxConsec;
}
```
