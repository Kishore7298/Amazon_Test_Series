## Minimum Depth of a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
            1
          /   \
         3     2
        /
       4

Output: 2

Explanation:
Minimum depth is between nodes 1 and 3.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
             10
          /     \
        20       30
          \        \
          40        60
                   /
                  2

Output: 3

Explanation:
Minimum depth is between nodes 10,20 and 40.
```

#### Your Task:

You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function `minDepth()` which takes root node as input parameter and returns the minimum depth.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(height of tree)`

```
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
```

```c++
/* The Node structure is
struct Node
{
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
}; */

/*You are required to complete this method*/
int minDepth(Node *node) {
    if(node == NULL)
        return 0;

    if(node->left == NULL)
        return 1 + minDepth(node->right);

    if(node->right == NULL)
        return 1 + minDepth(node->left);

    return 1 + min(minDepth(node->left), minDepth(node->right));
}
```
