## Diagonal Sum In Binary Tree

Consider Red lines of slope -1 passing between nodes (in following diagram). The diagonal sum in a binary tree is the sum of all nodeâ€™s data lying between these lines. Given a Binary Tree of size N, print all diagonal sums.

For the following input tree, output should be 9, 19, 42.  
9 is sum of 1, 3 and 5.  
19 is sum of 2, 6, 4 and 7.  
42 is sum of 9, 10, 11 and 12.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
         4
       /   \
      1     3
           /
          3
Output: 7 4
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
           10
         /    \
        8      2
       / \    /
      3   5  2
Output: 12 15 3
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to take input. Just complete the function `diagonalSum()` that takes root node of the tree as parameter and returns an array containing the diagonal sums for every diagonal present in the tree with slope `-1`.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1<=Number of nodes<=10^5
```

```c++
/*
    Complete the function below
    Node is as follows:
    struct Node{
        int data;
        Node *left,*right;
    };
*/
vector <int> diagonalSum(Node* root) {
    vector<int> res;
    unordered_map<int, int> mp;

    if(root == NULL)
        return res;

    queue<pair<Node*, int>> q;
    q.push({root, 0});
    int mini = INT_MAX;

    while(q.empty() == false) {
        auto elem  = q.front();
        q.pop();

        Node* curr = elem.first;
        int level = elem.second;
        mini = min(mini, level);

        mp[level] += curr->data;

        if(curr->right != NULL) {
            q.push({curr->right, level});
        }

        if(curr->left != NULL) {
            q.push({curr->left, level-1});
        }
    }

    for(int i =0; i>=mini; i--)
        res.push_back(mp[i]);

    return res;
}
```
