## Extreme nodes in alternate order

Given a binary tree, print nodes of extreme corners of each level but in alternate order.

Example:
![tree](https://contribute.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/extremeNode.png)

For above tree, the output is

```
1 2 7 8 31
– print rightmost node of 1st level
– print leftmost node of 2nd level
– print rightmost node of 3rd level
– print leftmost node of 4th level
– print rightmost node of 5th level
```

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
       1
     /  \
    2    3
Output: 1 2
Explanation: This represents a tree
with 3 nodes and 2 edges where root
is 1, left child of 1 is 3 and
right child of 1 is 2.
```

#### Your Task:

You don't have to take any input. Just complete the function `ExtremeNodes()` that takes root node as paramter and return the answer (as vector<int> in cpp, as ArrayList<Integer> in Java, as list in python)

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <=Number of nodes<= 100
1 <=Data of a node<= 1000
```

```c++
/*
 A binary tree node has data, pointer to left child
   and a pointer to right child
struct Node
{
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
};
*/

/* Function to print nodes of extreme corners
of each level in alternate order */
vector<int> ExtremeNodes(Node* root) {
    vector<int> res;
    if(root == NULL)
        return res;

    queue<Node*> q;
    int level = 0;
    q.push(root);
    while(q.empty() == false) {
        int count = q.size();
        for(int i = 0; i<count; i++) {
            Node* curr = q.front();
            q.pop();
            if(level%2 == 0 && i == count-1) {
                res.push_back(curr->data);
            }
            if(level%2 == 1 && i == 0) {
                res.push_back(curr->data);
            }
            if(curr->left != NULL)
                q.push(curr->left);

            if(curr->right != NULL)
                q.push(curr->right);
        }
        level++;
    }
    return res;
}

```
