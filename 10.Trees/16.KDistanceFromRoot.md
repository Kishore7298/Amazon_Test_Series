## K distance from root

Given a Binary Tree of size N and an integer K. Print all nodes that are at distance k from root (root is considered at distance 0 from itself). Nodes should be printed from left to right. If k is more that height of tree, nothing should be printed.

```
For example, if below is given tree and k is 2. Output should be 4 5 6.

          1
       /     \
     2        3
   /         /   \
  4        5    6
     \
      8
```

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
K = 0
      1
    /   \
   3     2
Output: 1
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
K = 3
        3
       /
      2
       \
        1
      /  \
     5    3
Output: 5 3
```

#### Your Task:

You don't have to take input. Complete the function `Kdistance()` that accepts root node and k as parameter and return the value of the nodes that are at a distance k from the root. (The values are returned as vector<int> in cpp, as ArrayList<Integer> in java and list in python)  
Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(Height of the Tree)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^4
0 <= K <= 30
```

```c++
/* A binary tree node has data, pointer to left child
   and a pointer to right child /
struct Node
{
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
}; */

// function should print the nodes at k distance from root
vector<int> Kdistance(struct Node *root, int k) {
    vector<int> res;
    if(root == NULL)
        return res;

    queue<pair<Node*, int>> q;
    q.push({root, k});
    while(q.empty() == false) {
        auto elem = q.front();
        q.pop();
        Node* curr = elem.first;
        int level = elem.second;
        if(level == 0) {
            res.push_back(curr->data);
            continue;
        }
        if(curr->left != NULL) {
            q.push({curr->left, level-1});
        }
        if(curr->right != NULL) {
            q.push({curr->right, level-1});
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```
