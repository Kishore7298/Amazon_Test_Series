## Sum Tree

Given a Binary Tree. Check whether it is a Sum Tree or not.

A Binary Tree is a Sum Tree in which value of each node x is equal to sum of nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree . An empty tree is also a Sum Tree as sum of an empty tree can be considered to be 0. A leaf node is also considered as a Sum Tree.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
    3
  /   \
 1     2

Output: 1
Explanation: The given tree is a sum
tree so return a boolean true.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:

          10
        /    \
      20      30
    /   \
   10    10

Output: 0
Explanation: The given tree is not a sum
tree. For the root node, sum of elements
in left subtree is 40 and sum of elements
in right subtree is 30. Root element = 10
which is not equal to 30+40.
```

#### Your Task:

You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function `isSumTree()` which takes root node as input parameter and returns true if the tree is a SumTree else it returns false.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(height of tree)`

```
Constraints:
1 â‰¤ number of nodes â‰¤ 10^4
```

```c++
/*  Tree node
struct Node
{
    int data;
    Node* left, * right;
}; */

// Should return true if tree is Sum Tree, else false
bool isSumTree(Node* root)
{
    if(root == NULL || (root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL)) // If node is NULL or if the node is leaf node
        return true;

    bool leftSumTree = isSumTree(root->left);
    bool rightSumTree = isSumTree(root->right);

    if(leftSumTree == false || rightSumTree == false)   // If either of the tree is not a sum tree
        return false;

    int sum  = 0;
    if(root->left != NULL) {
        if(root->left->left == NULL && root->left->right ==NULL)
            sum += root->left->data;    // for leaf
        else
            sum += 2*(root->left->data);    // for non leaf
    }
    if(root->right != NULL) {
        if(root->right->left == NULL && root->right->right == NULL)
            sum += root->right->data;   // for leaf
        else
            sum += 2*(root->right->data);   // for non leaf
    }
    if(root->data != sum)
        return false;

    return true;
}
```
