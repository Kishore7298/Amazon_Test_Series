## Diameter of Binary Tree

Given a Binary Tree, find diameter of it.

The diameter of a tree is the number of nodes on the longest path between two leaves in the tree. The diagram below shows two trees each with diameter nine, the leaves that form the ends of a longest path are shaded (note that there is more than one path in each tree of length nine, but no path longer than nine nodes).

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
       1
     /  \
    2    3
Output: 3
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
         10
        /   \
      20    30
    /   \
   40   60
Output: 4
```

#### Your Task:

You need to complete the function `diameter()` that takes node as parameter and returns the diameter.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(Height of the Tree)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 10000
1 <= Data of a node <= 1000
```

```c++
/* Tree node structure  used in the program

struct Node
{
    int data;
    struct Node* left;
    struct Node* right;

    Node(int x){
        data = x;
        left = right = NULL;
    }
}; */

// This function updates the diameter and returns the height of the tree
int diameterUtil(Node* node, int &d) {
    if(node == NULL)
        return 0;

    int leftHeight = diameterUtil(node->left, d);
    int rightHeight = diameterUtil(node->right, d);

    d = max(d, leftHeight + rightHeight +1);

    return max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
}

/* Computes the diameter of binary tree with given root.  */
int diameter(Node* node) {
    int d = 0;
    diameterUtil(node, d);
    return d;
}

```
