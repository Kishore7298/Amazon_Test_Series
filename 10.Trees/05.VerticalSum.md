## Vertical sum

Given a Binary Tree, find vertical sum of the nodes that are in same vertical line. Print all sums through different vertical lines starting from left-most vertical line to right-most vertical line.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
       1
    /   \
  2      3
 / \    / \
4   5  6   7
Output:
Explanation:
The tree has 5 vertical lines
Vertical-Line-1 has only one node
4 => vertical sum is 4
Vertical-Line-2: has only one node
2=> vertical sum is 2
Vertical-Line-3: has three nodes:
1,5,6 => vertical sum is 1+5+6 = 12
Vertical-Line-4: has only one node 3
=> vertical sum is 3
Vertical-Line-5: has only one node 7
=> vertical sum is 7
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to take input. Just complete the function `verticalSum()` that takes root node of the tree as parameter and returns an array containing the vertical sum of tree from left to right.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1<=Number of nodes<=1000
```

```c++
/*Complete the function below
Node is as follows:
struct Node{
int data;
Node *left,*right;
};
*/
vector<int> verticalSum(Node *root) {
    queue<pair<Node *, int>> q;
    int mini = INT_MAX; // Minimum level
    int maxx = INT_MIN; // Maximum level

    unordered_map<int, int> mp;
    q.push({root, 0});  // Pushing the root element to the queue with the level as 0

    while(q.empty() != true) {
        auto elem = q.front();  // Popping out the front element of queue
        q.pop();

        Node* curr = elem.first;
        int level = elem.second;

        mini = min(mini, level);    // Minimum level updation
        maxx = max(maxx, level);    // maximum level updation

        mp[level] += curr->data;

        if(curr->left != NULL) {
            q.push({curr->left, level-1});  // Decrementing the level for moving left
        }
        if(curr->right != NULL) {
            q.push({curr->right, level+1}); // Incrementing the level moving right
        }
    }

    vector<int> res;
    for(int i = mini; i<=maxx; i++) {
        res.push_back(mp[i]);
    }

    return res;
}
```
