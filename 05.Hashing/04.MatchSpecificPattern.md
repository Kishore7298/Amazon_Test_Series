## Match specific pattern

Given a dictionary of words and a pattern. Every character in the pattern is uniquely mapped to a character in the dictionary. Find all such words in the dictionary that match the given pattern.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 4
dict[] = {abb,abc,xyz,xyy}
pattern  = foo
Output: abb xyy
Explanation: xyy and abb have the same
character at index 1 and 2 like the
pattern.
```

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `findMatchedWords()` which takes an array of strings dict[] consisting of the words in the dictionary and a string, Pattern and returns an array of strings consisting of all the words in the dict[] that match the given Pattern in lexicographical order.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N*K) (where K is the length of the pattern)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10
```

```c++
// This function checks if the string matches with the pattern
bool checkPattern(string s, string pattern) {
    char assign[128] = { 0 }; // Mapping of pattern -> string
    for(int i=0; i<pattern.length(); i++) {
        if(assign[pattern[i]] == 0) // If the charecter is not assigned
            assign[pattern[i]] = s[i];  // mapping the string charecter to the pattern charecter
        else
            if(assign[pattern[i]] != s[i])  // If the charecter is already assigned and it doesn't match new char
                return false;   // Then return false.
    }
    return true;
}

/* The function returns a  vector of strings
present in the dictionary which matches
the string pattern.
You are required to complete this method */
vector<string> findMatchedWords(vector<string> dict, string pattern) {
    vector<string> res;
    for(string str: dict) {
        if(str.length() == pattern.length() && checkPattern(str, pattern)) {
            res.push_back(str);
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```
