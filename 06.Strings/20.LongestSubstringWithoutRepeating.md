#### Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string S, find the length of its longest substring that does not have any repeating characters.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
S = geeksforgeeks
Output: 7
Explanation: The longest substring
without repeated characters is "ksforge".
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
S = abbcdb
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring is
"bcd". Here "abcd" is not a substring
of the given string.
```

#### Your Task:

Complete SubsequenceLength function that takes string s as input and returns the length of the longest substring that does not have any repeating characters.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`

```
Constraints:
0<= N <= 10^5
here, N = S.length
```

```c++
// Approach is sliding window technique(varying size)
// s is the given string
int SubsequenceLength (string s) {
    int freq[26] = {0};

    int maxi = 0;
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    while(i < s.length()) {
        if(freq[s[i] -'a'] == 0) {
            freq[s[i] -'a'] = 1;
            i++;
        } else {
            maxi = max(maxi, i-j);
            freq[s[j] -'a']--;
            j++; // Increment j until it removes the frequency of the ith element.
        }
    }
    maxi = max(maxi, i-j);
    return maxi;
}
```
