## Generate Grey Code Sequences

Given a number N, your task is to complete the function which generates all n-bit grey code sequences, a grey code sequence is a sequence such that successive patterns in it differ by one bit.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 2
Output: 00 01 11 10
Explanation: All 2-bit gray codes are
00, 01, 11, 10 such that successive
patterns in it differ by one bit.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 1
Output: 0 1
```

#### Your Task:

Complete the function `generateCode()` which takes an integer as input parameter and retruns an array of all N bit grey code sequence such that successive patterns in it differ by one bit.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N * log N)`
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`

```
Constraints:
1<=N<=10
```

```c++
/*Returns an array of all n-bit gray codes sequence.
You are required to complete below method. */
vector <string> generateCode(int N) {
     vector<string>res = {"0", "1"};
     if(N == 1)
        return res;
    for(int i=2; i<=N; i++)
        for(int j=res.size()-1; j >=0; j--) {
            res.push_back("1" + res[j]);
            res[j] = "0"+res[j];
        }

    return res;
}
```
