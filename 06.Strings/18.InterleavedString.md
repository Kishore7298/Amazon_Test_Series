## Interleaved Strings

Given three strings A, B and C your task is to complete the function isInterleave which returns true if C is an interleaving of A and B else returns false. C is said to be interleaving A and B, if it contains all characters of A and B and order of all characters in individual strings is preserved.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
A = YX, B = X, C = XXY
Output: 0
Explanation: XXY is not interleaving
of YX and X
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
A = XY, B = X, C = XXY
Output: 1
Explanation: XXY is interleaving of
XY and X.
```

#### Your Task:

Complete the function `isInterleave()` which takes three strings A, B and C as input and returns true if C is an interleaving of A and B else returns false. (1 is printed by the driver code if the returned value is true, otherwise 0.)

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N * M)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N * M)`  
here, N = length of A, and M = length of B

```
Constraints:
1<=length of A, B, C <=100
```

```c++
bool isInterLeaveUtil(string A, string B, string C, int a, int b , int c) {
    if(a == -1 && b == -1 && c == -1)
        return true;

    if(c == -1)
        return false;

    return
        (A[a] == C[c] &&  isInterLeaveUtil(A, B, C, a-1, b, c-1)) ||
        (B[b] == C[c] && isInterLeaveUtil(A, B, C, a, b-1, c-1));
}

/*You are required to complete this method */
bool isInterleave(string A, string B, string C) {
    int a = A.length()-1;
    int b = B.length()-1;
    int c = C.length()-1;
    return isInterLeaveUtil(A, B, C, a, b, c);
}

```
