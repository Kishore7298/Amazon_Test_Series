## Reorder data files

You have an array of files names. Each file is a space delimited string of words.

The first word in each file is an alphanumeric identifier. Then, either:

Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
We will call these two varieties of files letter-files and digit-files. It is guaranteed that each file has at least one word after its identifier.

Reorder the files so that all of the letter-files come before any digit-files. The letter-files are ordered lexicographically without considering identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties. The digit-files should be put in their original order of occurance.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 3
filename[] = {file1 1 2 3, space2 geeksforgeeks
                     true1 check}
Output:
true1 check
space2 geeksforgeeks
file1 1 2 3
Explanation:  Since first we need to print the
letter-files there are two letter-files present
"true1 check" "space2 geeksforgeeks",
according to problem they should be sorted
after ignoring their identifier so "true1 check"
should comes before "space2 geeksforgeeks"
as (check < geeksforgeeks). Then we are left
with only one digit file i.e "file1 1 2 3" so we
will put it at last.
```

#### Your Task:

Complete `fileReorder()` function and return the vector of the string containing the files name in the required order.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N * files.length * Log(N))`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(N * files.length)`

```
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
3 <= files.length <= 100
```

```c++
// User function template for C++
bool isDigitFile(string &s) {
    int pos = s.find(" ");
    return isdigit(s[pos+1]);  // if the char right after the delimiter is digit
}

bool myComp(string s1, string s2) {
    int pos1 = s1.find(" ");
    int pos2 = s2.find(" ");
    return s1.substr(pos1+1) < s2.substr(pos2+1);
}

// files : given files vector
vector<string> fileReorder(vector<string> &files) {
    vector<string> digitFile, letterFile;
    for(int i=0; i<files.size(); i++) {
        if(isDigitFile(files[i])) {
            digitFile.push_back(files[i]);
        } else {
            letterFile.push_back(files[i]);
        }
    }
    sort(letterFile.begin(), letterFile.end(), myComp);
    vector<string> res;
    for(string i: letterFile)
        res.push_back(i);

    for(string i: digitFile)    // Digital files should be in the original order.
        res.push_back(i);
    return res;
}
```
