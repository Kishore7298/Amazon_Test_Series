## String Modification

Given a string with repeated characters, the task is to complete the function rearrangeString which rearrange characters in a string so that no two adjacent characters are same.  
Note : It may be assumed that the string has only lowercase English alphabets and such transformation is always always possible.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
S = aaabc
Output: 1
Explanation: We can transform the string
to abaca.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
S = aaabb
Output: 1
Explanation: We can transform the string
to ababa.
```

#### Your Task:

Complete the function `rearrangeString()` which takes a string as an input parameter and returns the rearranged string. (The output will be 1 if the returned string has no adjacent character same, otherwise 0. Printing is done by the driver's code.)

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N * log N), N = length of string`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(26)`

```
Constraints:
1<=|s|<=100
```

```c++
/* The below function should return
the transformed string */
string rearrangeString(string str) {
   string res;
   sort(str.begin(), str.end());    // Sorting the string to get the frequency quickly

   priority_queue<pair<int, char>> pq;
   char curr = str[0];  // Currently selected string
   char curr_count = 1; // Count of the currently selected string
   for(int i = 1; i<str.length(); i++) {
       if(str[i] == curr) { // If is same as previous
           curr_count++;    // Increment the count
       } else {
           pq.push({curr_count, curr}); //If different, push the last element to the queue with frequency
           curr = str[i];   // Make the current element as the current element.
           curr_count = 1;
       }
   }
   pq.push({curr_count, curr}); // Pushing the last element.

 /*
    Use priority queue.
    Insert the into the priority queue in the form of pair({occurence of that character, character}).
    Pop from the priority queue and add the character to the answer string and decrement the frequency of the character and store it into a variable(say, prev).
    Then pop the next element from the priority queue and then add the character to answer string and decrement the frequency of that character.
    Now check if the previous character's frequency is still greater than zero then add this character pair in the priority queue.
    Repeat the process until priority queue is empty.
 */

   pair<int, char> prev = pq.top();
   pq.pop();
   res += prev.second;
   prev.first--;
   while(pq.empty() == false) {
       auto current = pq.top();
       pq.pop();
       res += current.second;
       current.first--;
       if(prev.first > 0)
            pq.push(prev);
        prev = current;
   }
   return res;
}
```
