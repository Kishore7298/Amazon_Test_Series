## Validate an IP Address

Write a program to Validate an IPv4 Address. According to Wikipedia, IPv4 addresses are canonically represented in dot-decimal notation, which consists of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots, e.g., 172.16.254.1 . The generalized form of an IPv4 address is (0-255).(0-255).(0-255).(0-255). Here we are considering numbers only from 0 to 255 and any additional leading zeroes will be considered invalid.

Your task is to complete the function isValid which returns 1 if the ip address is valid else returns 0. The function takes a string ip as its only argument .

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
ip = 222.111.111.111
Output: 1
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
ip = 5555..555
Output: 0
Explanation: 5555..555 is not a valid
ip address, as the middle two portions
are missing.
```

#### Your Task:

Complete the function `isValid()` which takes a character array as input parameter and returns 1 if this is a valid ip address otherwise returns 0.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N), N = length of string`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`

```
Constraints:
1<=length of string <=50
```

Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.

```c++
/* The function returns 1 if
IP string is valid else return 0
You are required to complete this method */
int isValid(char *ip) {
    int num = 0;    // Stores the number in the delimiter.
    int count = 0;  // Counts the number of dots
    int bitCount = 0;   // Count of charecters within . delimiter
    for(int i=0; ip[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        if(ip[i] == '.') {
            bitCount = 0;
            if(i == 0 || ip[i-1] == '.')
                return 0;
            count++;
            if(!(num >=0 && num <= 255))
                return 0;
            num = 0;
        } else {
            bitCount++;
            if(ip[i] - '0' > 9 || ip[i] - '0' < 0) {
               return 0;
            }
            num *= 10;
            num += ip[i] - '0';
            if(bitCount > 1 && (num < ((bitCount-1)*10)))    //for 00.00.00.01
                return 0;
        }
    }
    if(count != 3)
        return 0;
    return 1;
}
```
