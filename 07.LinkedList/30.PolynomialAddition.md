## Polynomial Addition

Given two polynomial numbers represented by a linked list. The task is to complete the function `addPolynomial()` that adds these lists meaning adds the coefficients who have same variable powers.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
LinkedList1:  (1,x2)
LinkedList2:  (1,x3)
Output:
1x^3 + 1x^2
Explanation: Since, x2 and x3 both have
different powers as 2 and 3. So, their
coefficient can't be added up.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
LinkedList1:  (1,x3) -> (1,x2)
LinkedList2:  (3,x3) -> (4,x2)
Output:
4x^3 + 6x^2
Explanation: Since, x3 has two different
coefficients as 3 and 1. Adding them up
will lead to 4x3. Also, x2 has two
coefficients as 4 and 2. So, adding them
up will give 6x2.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `addPolynomial()` which should add the polynomial with same powers return the required polynomial in decreasing order of the power in the form of a linked list.
Note: Try to solve the question without using any extra space.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N+M)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= N, M <= 10^5
1 <= x, y <= 10^6
```

```c++
/* Structure of Node used
struct Node
{
    int coeff;
    int pow;
    struct Node* next;

    Node(int c, int p){
        coeff = c;
        pow = p;
        next = NULL;
    }

};
*/

/* The below method print the required sum of polynomial
p1 and p2 as specified in output  */
Node* addPolynomial(Node *p1, Node *p2) {
    Node* tail = new Node(0, 0);
    Node* head = tail;
    Node* a = p1;
    Node* b = p2;
    while(a != NULL && b != NULL) {
        if(a->pow == b->pow) {
            a->coeff += b->coeff;
            tail->next = a;
            a = a->next;
            b = b->next;
        } else if (b->pow > a->pow) {
            tail->next = b;
            b = b->next;
        } else if (a->pow > b->pow) {
            tail->next = a;
            a = a->next;
        }
        tail = tail->next;
    }
    if(a != NULL) {
        tail->next = a;
    } else if (b != NULL) {
        tail->next = b;
    }
    return head->next;
}
```
