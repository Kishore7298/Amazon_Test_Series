## Delete nodes having greater value on right

Given a singly linked list, remove all the nodes which have a greater value on its next adjacent element.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
LinkedList = 12->15->10->11->5->6->2->3
Output: 15 11 6 3
Explanation: Since, 12, 10, 5 and 2 are
the elements which have greater elements
on their next node. So, after deleting
them, the linked list would like be 15,
11, 6, 3.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
LinkedList = 10->20->30->40->50->60
Output: 60
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `compute()` which should modify the list as required and return the head of the modified linked list. The printing is done by the driver code,

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= size of linked list <= 1000
1 <= element of linked list <= 1000
Note: Try to solve the problem without using any extra space.
```

```c++
/*

The structure of linked list is the following

struct Node
{
    int data;
    Node* next;

    Node(int x){
        data = x;
        next = NULL;
    }
};
*/
Node* reverseList(Node* head) {
    if(head == NULL || head->next == NULL)
        return head;

    Node* prev = NULL;
    Node* curr = head;
    while(curr != NULL) {
        Node* next = curr->next;
        curr->next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
    }
    return prev;
}

Node *compute(Node *head)
{
    Node* reverse = reverseList(head);
    Node* res = new Node(0);
    Node* tail = res;
    while(reverse != NULL) {
        if(reverse->data >= tail->data) {
            tail->next = reverse;
            tail = tail->next;
        }
        reverse = reverse->next;
    }
    tail->next = NULL;
    return reverseList(res->next);
}
```
