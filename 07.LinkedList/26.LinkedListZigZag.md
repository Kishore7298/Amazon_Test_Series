## Linked List in Zig-Zag fashion

Given a Linked list, rearrange it such that converted list should be of the form `a < b > c < d > e < f ..` where a, b, c are consecutive data node of linked list and such that the order of linked list is sustained.  
For example: In 11 15 20 5 10 we consider only 11 20 5 15 10 because it satisfies the above condition and the order of linked list. 5 20 11 15 10 is not considered as it does not follow the order of linked list.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4
Output: 1 3 2 4
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
LinkedList: 11->15->20->5->10
Output: 11 20 5 15 10
Explanation: In the given linked list,
after arranging them as 11 < 20 > 5
< 15 > 10 in the pattern as asked above.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `zigZag()` which should reorder the list as required and return the head of the linked list.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= size of linked list(a) <= 1000
```

```c++
/*

The structure of linked list is the following
struct Node
{
    int data;
    Node* next;

    Node(int x){
        data = x;
        next = NULL;
    }

};
*/


Node *zigZag(Node* head)
{
 if(head == NULL || head->next == NULL)
    return head;
 Node* curr = head->next;
 Node* prev = head;
 while(curr != NULL) {
     if(curr->data < prev->data) {
         swap(curr->data, prev->data);
     }
     prev= curr;
     curr = curr->next;
     if(curr != NULL) {
         if(curr->data > prev->data) {
             swap(curr->data, prev->data);
         }
         prev= curr;
         curr = curr->next;
     }
 }
 return head;
}
```
