## Merge two sorted linked lists

Given two sorted linked lists consisting of N and M nodes respectively. The task is to merge both of the list (in-place) and return head of the merged list.
Note: It is strongly recommended to do merging in-place using O(1) extra space.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 4, M = 3
valueN[] = {5,10,15,40}
valueM[] = {2,3,20}
Output: 2 3 5 10 15 20 40
Explanation: After merging the two linked
lists, we have merged list as 2, 3, 5,]
10, 15, 20, 40.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 2, M = 2
valueN[] = {1,1}
valueM[] = {2,4}
Output:1 1 2 4
Explanation: After merging the given two
linked list , we have 1, 1, 2, 4 as
output.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `sortedMerge()` which takes references to the heads of two linked lists as the arguments and returns the head of merged linked list.

Expected Time Complexity : `O(n+m)`  
Expected Auxilliary Space : `O(1)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= N, M <= 10^4
1 <= Node's data <= 10^5
```

```c++
/* Link list Node
struct Node {
  int data;
  struct Node *next;

  Node(int x) {
    data = x;
    next = NULL;
  }
};
*/

Node* sortedMerge(Node* head_A, Node* head_B) {
    Node* head = NULL;
    Node* a = head_A;
    Node* b = head_B;
    Node* tail = NULL;
    if(a->data < b->data) {
        tail = a;
        a = a->next;
        head = tail;
    } else {
        tail = b;
        b = b->next;
        head = tail;
    }
    while(a != NULL && b != NULL) {
        if(a->data < b->data) {
            tail->next = a;
            a = a->next;
        } else {
            tail->next = b;
            b = b->next;
        }
        tail = tail->next;
    }

    if(a != NULL) {
        tail->next = a;
    } else {
        tail->next = b;
    }
    return head;
}

```
