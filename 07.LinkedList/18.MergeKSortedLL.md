## Merge K sorted linked lists

Given K sorted linked lists of different sizes. The task is to merge them in such a way that after merging they will be a single sorted linked list.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
K = 4
value = {{1,2,3},{4 5},{5 6},{7,8}}
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8
Explanation:
The test case has 4 sorted linked
list of size 3, 2, 2, 2
1st    list     1 -> 2-> 3
2nd   list      4->5
3rd    list      5->6
4th    list      7->8
The merged list will be
1->2->3->4->5->5->6->7->8.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
K = 3
value = {{1,3},{4,5,6},{8}}
Output: 1 3 4 5 6 8
Explanation:
The test case has 3 sorted linked
list of size 2, 3, 1.
1st list 1 -> 3
2nd list 4 -> 5 -> 6
3rd list 8
The merged list will be
1->3->4->5->6->8.
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `mergeKList()` which merges the K given lists into a sorted one. The printing is done automatically by the driver code.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(nk Logk)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(k)`  
Note: n is the maximum size of all the k link list

```
Constraints
1 <= K <= 10^3
```

```c++
/*Linked list Node structure

struct Node
{
	int data;
	Node* next;

	Node(int x){
	    data = x;
	    next = NULL;
	}

};
*/

/* arr[] is an array of pointers to heads of linked lists
  and N is size of arr[]  */
Node * mergeKLists(Node *arr[], int N)
{
    Node* tail = new Node(0);
    Node* head = tail;

    priority_queue<pair<int, Node *>, vector<pair<int, Node*>>, greater<pair<int, Node*>>> pq;
    for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {
        pq.push({arr[i]->data  ,arr[i]});
    }

    while(pq.empty() == false) {
        auto elem = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        tail->next = elem.second;
        tail = tail->next;
        if(elem.second->next != NULL) {
            pq.push({elem.second->next->data, elem.second->next});
        }
    }
    tail->next = NULL;
    return head->next;
}
```
