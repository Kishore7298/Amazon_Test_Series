## Given a linked list, reverse alternate nodes and append at the end

Given a linked list, you have to perform the following task:

1. Extract the alternative nodes from starting from second node.
2. Reverse the extracted list.
3. Append the extracted list at the end of the original list.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
LinkedList = 10->4->9->1->3->5->9->4
Output: 10 9 3 9 4 5 1 4
Explanation: Reversing the alternative
nodes from the given list, and then
appending them to the end of the list
results in a list with the elements as
10 9 3 9 4 5 1 4.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
LinkedList = 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 1 3 5 4 2
Explanation:
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `rearrange()` which should rearrange the list as required.

Note: Try to solve the problem without using any extra memory.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 50
1 <= Node_value <= 1000
```

```c++
/*
  reverse alternate nodes and append at the end
  The input list will have at least one element
  Node is defined as
  struct Node
  {
      int data;
      struct Node *next;

      Node(int x){
        data = x;
        next = NULL;
      }

   };

*/

Node* reverseList(Node* head) {
    if(head == NULL || head->next == NULL)
        return head;

    Node* prev = NULL;
    Node* curr = head;
    while(curr != NULL) {
        Node* next = curr->next;
        curr->next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
    }
    return prev;
}

void rearrange(struct Node *odd) {
    Node *original, *alternate, *originalHead, *alternateHead;
    original = new Node(0);
    alternate = new Node(0);
    originalHead = original;
    alternateHead = alternate;

    Node* curr = odd;
    while(curr != NULL) {
        original->next = curr;
        original = original->next;
        curr = curr->next;
        if(curr != NULL) {
            alternate->next = curr;
            alternate = alternate->next;
            curr = curr->next;
        }
    }
    alternate->next = NULL;
    original->next = reverseList(alternateHead->next);
    free(originalHead);
    free(alternateHead);
}
```

#### Editorial:

```c++
void rearrange(struct Node *odd)
{
    if (odd == NULL || odd->next == NULL || odd->next->next == NULL)
        // for less than 3 nodes, no rearrangement is required
        return;

    struct Node *even = odd->next;    // even points at the second node
    odd->next = odd->next->next;      // placing third node after first
    odd = odd->next;                  // odd now points to the third node
    even->next = NULL;                // placing NULL after second node

    while (odd && odd->next)
    {
        struct Node *temp = odd->next->next;   // next odd node
        odd->next->next = even;       // connecting next even node to even
        even = odd->next;             // moving to next even node
        odd->next = temp;             // connecting odd to next odd node

        if (temp != NULL)
            odd = temp;
    }
    odd->next = even;
}
```
