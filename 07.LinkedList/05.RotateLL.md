## Rotate a Linked List

Given a singly linked list of size N. The task is to rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes, where k is a given positive integer smaller than or equal to length of the linked list.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 8
value[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
k = 4
Output: 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4
Explanation:
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 5
value[] = {2,4,7,8,9}
k = 3
Output: 8 9 2 4 7
Explanation:
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `rotate()` which takes a head reference as the first argument and k as the second argument. The printing is done automatically by the driver code.

Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`.  
Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`.

```
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= k <= 10^3
```

```c++
/*

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
    Node(int x) {
        data = x;
        next = NULL;
    }
};

*/

// This function should rotate list counter-clockwise
// by k and return new head (if changed)

Node* rotate(Node* head, int k) {
    Node* curr = head;
    for(int i=0; i<k-1; i++) {  // Move the curr till the partition
        curr = curr->next;
    }
    if(curr->next == NULL)  // n == k;
        return head;

    Node* newHead = curr->next; // Store the new head which is right after the partition(k length).
    curr->next = NULL;  // Break the linkedList till the partition
    curr = newHead;
    while(curr->next != NULL)   // Reach the end in other partition
        curr = curr->next;
    curr->next = head;  // Attach the old head to the end of new prtition
    return newHead;
}

```
