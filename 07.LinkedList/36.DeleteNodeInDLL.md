## Delete node in Doubly Linked List

Given a doubly linked list and a position. The task is to delete a node from given position in a doubly linked list.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
LinkedList = 1 <--> 3 <--> 4
x = 3
Output: 1 3
Explanation: After deleting the node at
position 3 (position starts from 1),
the linked list will be now as 1->3.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
LinkedList = 1 <--> 5 <--> 2 <--> 9
x = 1
Output: 5 2 9
```

#### Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `deleteNode()` which should delete the node at given position and return the head of the linkedlist.

Expected Time Complexity : `O(N)`  
Expected Auxilliary Space : `O(1)`

```
Constraints:
2 <= size of the linked list <= 1000
1 <= x <= N
```

```c++
/* Structure of Node
struct Node
{
  int data;
  struct Node *next;
  struct Node *prev;

  Node(int x){
      data = x;
      next = NULL;
      prev = NULL;
  }

};
*/

// Function to delete the node at position x
Node* deleteNode(Node **head_ref, int x) {
    Node* head = *(head_ref);
  if(x == 1) {
      Node* temp = head;
      head = head->next;
      head->prev = NULL;
      free(temp);
      *head_ref = head;
      return head;
  }
  x -= 2;
  Node* curr = head;
  while(curr != NULL && x--) {
     curr = curr->next;
  }
  if(curr == NULL || curr->next == NULL)
    return head;
  Node* next = curr->next;
  curr->next = next->next;
  if(next->next != NULL) {
      next->prev = curr;
  }
  return head;
}
```
